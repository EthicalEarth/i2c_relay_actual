FAQ:

-How to get your program?

-Very easy:

0) run: git clone https://github.com/EthicalEarth/i2c_relay
1) run: cd i2c_relay
2) run: cmake .
3) run: make
4) run: ls,  and you can see i2c_relay binary file.

-How to control relay module?

-Use sytax: ./i2c_relay --set [number of (gpio 1-8) relay] [status 0 or 1]

-You can reset all relays: ./i2c_relay --reset
(In my program first relay connect to fisrt GPIO of PCF8574). 

You can make adapter via PCB [https://github.com/EthicalEarth/i2c_relay_PCB_BOARD] (See [https://github.com/EthicalEarth/i2c_relay_PCB_BOARD/blob/master/PDF_NEXT_RE-DESIGNED.pdf])

-Address of my chip is not 0x38. Program not work.

0) Get address by cmdline: i2cdetect -y 1
1) Open file main.cpp and change address.
2) Compile programm.
Same too if your i2c adapter is not /dev/i2c-1, just change it in function readwritebuffer.
